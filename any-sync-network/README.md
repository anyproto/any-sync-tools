# Any-Sync Network
Configuration builder for Any-Sync nodes.

## Installation
You can download the binary release here: https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync-tools/releases  

#### Build from source   
```
go install github.com/anyproto/any-sync-tools/any-sync-network@latest
```

## Usage
```
any-sync-network create
```
Use the interactive CLI to describe the parameters of basic nodes and create additional nodes if needed. 

Note that there are prerequisites for successful configuration:
1. `any-sync-coordinator` node and `any-sync-consensusnode` require MongoDB.
2. `any-sync-filenode` requires an S3-compatible object storage and Redis.

You can use the generated `*.yml` files as your nodes' and `anytype-heart`'s configurations.

### Example
![Interactive CLI demo](../assets/any-sync-network-example.gif)

Configuring a network with three sync nodes and one file node.
