# Any-Sync Tools

## `any-sync-network`
Configuration builder for Any-Sync nodes.

### Installation
1. Clone `any-sync-tools` repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository and run `go install ./any-sync-network`.

### Usage
```
any-sync-network create
```
Use the interactive CLI to describe the parameters of basic nodes and create additional nodes if needed. 

Note that there are prerequisites for successful configuration:
1. `consensus-node` requires MongoDB.
2. `file-node` requires an S3 bucket and Redis.

You can use the generated `*.yml` files as your nodes' configurations.

### Example
